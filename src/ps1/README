PS1 components

- CPU:
  * LSI CoreWare CW33300-based core (MIPS R3000A 32-bit)
  * Geometry Transform Engine (GTE)
  * Motion Decoder (MDEC)
  * System Control Coprocessor (Cop0)

- Memory:
  * 2MB EDO DRAM
  * 1MB framebuffer(GPU) and 512KB(SPU)
  * BIOS on 512KB ROM
  * PS1 has no MMU so no virtual memory
  * memory map [KUSEG, KSEG0, KSEG1], [Main RAM, Expansion region 1, Scratchpad, Hardware registers, BIOS ROM], check [ https://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm ]
  * we only care about which region is in use is when we implement the cache instruction and only for KSEG1 (only non-cached region) (it doesn't matter which region the peripherals are accessed)

- GPU:
  * 1KB of data cache
  * 1KB of instruction cache
  * no need to implement data cache (data cache is not used, instead its memory is mapped as the scratpad at a fixed location)

- SPU (Sound Processing Unit):

- I/O system connectivity

- Software:
  * BIOS for different models [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_models ]
  * No OS (or minimal OS functionality)
  * No kernel/user privilege separation (everything runs in kernel mode)
