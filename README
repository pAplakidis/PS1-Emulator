This is an emulator for ps1 writen in C++

special thanks for this awesome tutorial [ https://github.com/simias/psx-guide ]

Coding Style:
* registers: reg_...
* variables and functions: lower case separated with _
* "{" goes on the same line with the statement

Requirements:
- CMake

Install:
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- make

Run:
- cd build
- ./PS1-Emulator <bios> <game_rom>

TODO:
* Add #pragma once so we dont reinclude multiple files more than once
* Read find and read test-ROMs
* DOCUMENT NAMES TO THE INDEXES OF REGISTERS IN THE GENERAL PURPOSE REGISTER ARRAY IN CPU
* Code the CPU emulation (MIPS)
* Code the Debugger
* Garbage collect and check memory managemnt (optimization)
* implement all components
* try BIOS and tests (CPU, GPU, SPU, etc)
* try to run an actual game-ROM (debug the whole thing)
* ps1 doesn't have on OS but an interface/program that loads stuff (doesn't interact with user)
